%% Circular Hough Transform Demonstration
%
% David Young
%
% Demonstrates the use of |circle_hough| and |circle_houghpeaks| to find
% circular objects in an image.
%
% Uses the Image Processing Toolbox

%% Setup
% Reads an example image, gets its edges and displays them

im = imread('coins.png');
e = edge(im, 'canny');
imshow(e);

%% Carry out the HT
% The circles round the coins have radii in the 20-30 pixels range. To make
% sure we cover the range, we search radii from 15 to 40 pixels, in steps
% of 1 pixel.
%
% We select the 'same' option to simplify later processing, and the
% 'normalise' option to avoid a bias towards finding larger circles.

radii = 15:1:40;
h = circle_hough(e, radii, 'same', 'normalise');


%% Find some peaks in the accumulator
% We use the neighbourhood-suppression method of peak finding to ensure
% that we find spatially separated circles. We select the 10 most prominent
% peaks, because as it happens we can see that there are 10 coins to find.

peaks = circle_houghpeaks(h, radii, 'nhoodxy', 15, 'nhoodr', 21, 'npeaks', 10);

%% Look at the results
% We draw the circles found on the image, using both the positions and the
% radii stored in the |peaks| array. The |circlepoints| function is
% convenient for this - it is also used by |circle_hough| so comes with it.

imshow(im);
hold on;
for peak = peaks
    [x, y] = circlepoints(peak(3));
    plot(x+peak(1), y+peak(2), 'g-');
end
hold off
